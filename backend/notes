A Submission model generally tracks individual code submissions, especially for coding questions, while a QuizAttempt model tracks a user's overall attempt at a quiz.

Coding Challenge Execution APIs
    Run Code (without submission) (POST /api/coding/run)

        Runs user code with sample test cases
        Returns output
    Submit Code for Evaluation (POST /api/coding/submit)

        Runs user code against hidden test cases
        Stores result in database

so basically 5-10 decent number of question i have to fetch, so that if user leave early - we don't loose track.
